After extensive refinement, v6 is officially released! This upgrade focuses on deep technical optimizations for better performance and developer experience:

- **Technical Upgrades**: Minimum React 18 support; defaults to Pure CSS Variables mode, supporting zero-runtime styles and real-time theme switching.
- **Semantic Structure**: All components now feature semantic DOM structure, enabling flexible customization via `classNames`.
- **New Features**: Added Masonry component; Tooltip panning; InputNumber spinner mode; Resizable Drawer; default blur mask for overlays.
- **Smooth Migration**: Direct upgrade from v5 without codemod tools. For v5 documentation, please visit [5x.ant.design](https://5x.ant.design).
