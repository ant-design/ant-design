## When To Use

- Use when a container needs stronger visual emphasis without introducing business state semantics.
- Suitable for login panels, recommendation cards, AI modules, and key CTA blocks.
- As a decorative effect, it should not replace focus rings, validation borders, or status feedback.

### BorderBeam

| Property | Description | Type | Default | Version | [Global Config](/components/config-provider#component-config) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| children | Decorated content | `ReactNode` | - | 6.4.0 | × |
| color | Beam color configuration. Supports a single color string or gradient stops. `percent` uses the `0 ~ 100` input range and BorderBeam reserves tail space for the transparent fade | `string \| { color: string; percent: number }[]` | - | 6.4.0 | × |
| outset | Outset distance of the beam layer from the container edge. Set to `0` for clipped containers | `number \| string` | `1` | 6.4.0 | × |

## FAQ

### How does BorderBeam behave when reduced motion is enabled? {#faq-reduced-motion}

`BorderBeam` treats the beam as a decorative effect. When `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is active, the beam effect is hidden.

### What does `percent` mean in `color`? {#faq-color-percent}

`percent` represents the authored stop position and accepts values from `0` to `100`. BorderBeam maps those stops into the visible beam segment and reserves the trailing area for transparent fade-out so the moving tail stays visible.

### Do I need to set `position` myself? {#faq-position}

`BorderBeam` first attempts to insert the beam layer into the root node of `children` so the original component layout is not changed by an extra wrapper. When this mode is used, make sure the inserted root node can position the beam holder, such as by setting its `position` to a non-`static` value. BorderBeam does not inspect or patch the child position for you; it only falls back to its own wrapper when the child cannot host the beam holder.

For performance reasons, whether `children` can host the beam is resolved during initialization and is not continuously updated when the child structure or positioning styles change later.

### How do I keep the beam radius aligned with my container? {#faq-radius}

`BorderBeam` reads the computed `border-radius` from the actual container during initialization. This works best for a single-container child such as `Card`; for more complex child trees, set the radius on the actual container root for a more deterministic result.

For performance reasons, the radius is not continuously measured after the initial calculation. Later radius changes caused by size, ancestor styles, or internal child state are not guaranteed to resync automatically. The running beam may still apply internal motion smoothing.

For example:

```tsx
const radius = 24;

<BorderBeam>
  <Card style={{ borderRadius: radius }} />
</BorderBeam>;
```
