### onChange

> ðŸ’¡ The function will be called when uploading is in progress, completed, or failed.

When uploading state change, it returns:

```jsx
{
  file: { /* ... */ },
  fileList: [ /* ... */ ],
  event: { /* ... */ },
}
```

1. `file` File object for the current operation.

   ```jsx
   {
      uid: 'uid',      // unique identifier, negative is recommended, to prevent interference with internally generated id
      name: 'xx.png',   // file name
      status: 'done' | 'uploading' | 'error' | 'removed', // Intercepted file by beforeUpload doesn't have a status field.
      response: '{"status": "success"}', // response from server
      linkProps: '{"download": "image"}', // additional HTML props of file link
      xhr: 'XMLHttpRequest{ ... }', // XMLHttpRequest Header
   }
   ```

2. `fileList` current list of files

3. `event` response from the server, including uploading progress, supported by advanced browsers.

## FAQ

### How do I implement upload server side?

- You can consult [jQuery-File-Upload](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki#server-side) about how to implement server side upload interface.
- There is a mock example of [express](https://github.com/react-component/upload/blob/211979fdaa2c7896b6496df7061a0cfc0fc5434e/server.js) in rc-upload.

### I want to display download links.

Please set property `url` of each item in `fileList` to control the content of the link.

### How to use `customRequest`?

See <https://github.com/react-component/upload#customrequest>.

### Why will the `fileList` that's in control not trigger `onChange` `status` update when the file is not in the list?

`onChange` will only trigger when the file is in the list, it will ignore any events removed from the list. Please note that there does exist a bug which makes an event still trigger even when the file is not in the list before `4.13.0`.

### Why does `onChange` sometimes return File object and other times return { originFileObj: File }?

For compatible case, we return File object when `beforeUpload` return `false`. It will merge to `{ originFileObj: File }` in the next major version. Current version is compatible to get origin file by `info.file.originFileObj`. You can change this before a major release.

### Why sometimes Chrome can not upload?

Chrome update will also break native upload. Please restart Chrome to finish the upload job.

### Can still select files when uploading a folder in Safari?

Inside the upload component, we use the `directory` and `webkitdirectory` properties to control only directories can be selected. However, in Safari's implementation it doesn't seem to work. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/55649945/3040605). Please try passing an additional `accept` attribute that cannot match any files. For example:

```jsx
accept: `.${'n'.repeat(100)}`;
```
