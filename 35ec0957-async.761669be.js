In the application-level CSS-in-JS solution, since props may affect the component style, it is inevitable that the component style will be regenerated during the rendering phase.

Since styled has certain optimizations when dealing with stable styles, the performance of secondary rendering in this benchmark is better, but it will still be affected by recalculation like emotion when props participate in style calculation.
