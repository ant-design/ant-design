The existence of hash values serves two purposes: style isolation and caching. In the context of dynamic CSS themes, we can discard the caching feature since we have replaced all tokens with CSS variables.

Therefore, we can use random hashes to ensure style isolation.",paraId:47,tocIndex:9},{value:"At this point, we can see that users can simply modify tokens in the ConfigProvider, just like before, to use dynamic themes without any noticeable changes in usage.

The impact of this depends on the user's specific usage patterns.",paraId:48,tocIndex:9},{value:"The above solution can actually address most of the issues in various scenarios. However, let's revisit a problem mentioned from the beginning: the FOUC issue.

We must provide users with the ability to modify the theme before the browser renders the page.",paraId:49,tocIndex:10},{value:"The implementation of this capability essentially involves allowing users to replace CSS variables in scripts. As mentioned earlier, one method is to directly replace the class or attribute on the HTML in the script to apply statically compiled CSS variables, which is not suitable for dynamic themes. Therefore, users need to directly modify the values of CSS variables in the script, introducing the problem of 'needing to know the hash value in advance.' If the hash value is completely random or calculated based on tokens, users cannot use this hash value outside the React lifecycle, or it is challenging to save this hash value for use in scripts outside the React lifecycle.",paraId:50,tocIndex:10},{value:"In other words, as long as the user knows the hash value, is that sufficient? Therefore, we allow users to customize the hash value, and users do not need to worry about the loss of style isolation due to custom reasons\u2014because we can easily detect if users are using the same hash value in the application. In this way, users only need to override hashed CSS variables in the format of Ant Design (antd)\u2014we can provide a factory function to help users generate CSS variable styles.",paraId:51,tocIndex:10},{value:"After ceasing the active calculation of the hash, two questions arise:",paraId:52,tocIndex:11},{value:"Is it still a hash?",paraId:53,tocIndex:11},{value:"Do we still need to add hash to the styles?",paraId:53,tocIndex:11},{value:"The first question is somewhat philosophical.

However, since it is no longer necessary to compute it, it is simply a pure random value or a user-defined string.",paraId:54,tocIndex:11},{value:"The second question is crucial. Now that all tokens have been replaced, styles under different themes no longer have any differences, and the isolating role played by the hash is no longer significant.
