It is prevalent in both digital products and offline goods. Contrasting from Copyrighted information, illustrations not only carry information through intuition but also carries emotions and resulting in higher immersion and empathy for the customer. This leads to better user experience while accomplishing business goals. Illustrations contains inherit complexity due to the apparent personal style of the artist. It is a challenge to reproduce a consistent style between a team of artists, on the other hand, there is inherit risk when relying on a single artist for all the illustrations in a project. An illustration system is particular crucial in providing consistent branding. improving productivity. Avoiding risk in this regard is of great importance.",paraId:1,tocIndex:0},{value:"\n  ",paraId:0},{value:"From the most foundational design principles to the uppermost design techniques, HiTu adopted the design inspired by ETCG.

Technology represents a strong engineering foundation, providing strong support for all digital products while opening a window of possibility.

The combinations between each of them could meet the demands of many different business requirements.",paraId:3,tocIndex:2},{value:"\n  ",paraId:0},{value:"Sea Hare's color matching system is inspired by Ant Design's application of color palette in scenes. Differing from the UI's color scheme. The color matching system used in illustrations will be relatively more vibrant and flexible.

With HiTu's design principles as a guide, I recommend designers to construct a sense of spatial awareness along the Z-axis, dividing the illustration into 3 layers of foreground, middle ground and background.

The foreground should also have the highest saturation and visibility, both decreasing in level as the level decreases.",paraId:11}];}}]);
