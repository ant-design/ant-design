The difference from traditional graphic design is that the layout space of UI interface should be based on the dynamic and systematic perspective. We were inspired by the architectural ethic of the architect Le Corbusier and explored the dynamic spatial order in UI design and formed the interface layout of Ant Design based on the principle of 'beauty of order', making it possible for designers to create spatial layout that comes with rational beauty.",paraId:0},{value:"While defining the layout system in a visual system, we propose to start from the following 5 aspects:\uFF1A",paraId:1},{value:"Unified Canvas Dimension",paraId:2},{value:"Adaptation",paraId:2},{value:"Grid Unit",paraId:2},{value:"Raster",paraId:2},{value:"Common Scales",paraId:2},{value:"In order to minimize communication cost, it is necessary to unify the size of the design board within the organization.

Taking the structure of the 1440 top-bottom layout as an example, the content area with a width of 1168 is divided into 24 grids, as shown in the following picture.

In order to help designers of various levels to have consistency and similar rhythm in designing page layout, to unify designing language and reduce the restoration losses, Ant Design proposed the concept of UI common scales. From a large amount of practices, we have extracted a set of arrays that can be used as dimensions for UI layout decision. All the numbers are multiples of 8 and have a dynamic sense of rhythm. After verification, it can help us to achieve a faster and better design decision making of layout design.",paraId:14,tocIndex:6},{value:'The result of Ant Design in layout space is not to limit design output, but to guide designers to do it better. The two 8-fold array can be made into a myriad of possibilities by permutations and combinations, but there is a difference between "simply applying a permutation" and "really well designed". We need to consider availability in the pursuit of beauty, and we\'re still on our way to achieve a design system that is both reasonable and elegant. There are still plenty of things to explore for enterprise-level application interface layout. translate-layout',paraId:15,tocIndex:7}];}}]);
