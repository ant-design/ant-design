# CODEOWNERS syntax
# A CODEOWNERS file uses a pattern that follows the same rules used in gitignore files.
# The pattern is followed by one or more GitHub usernames or team names using the standard @username or @org/team-name format.
# You can also refer to a user by an email address that has been added to their GitHub account, for example user@example.com.
