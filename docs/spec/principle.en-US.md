“It is more difficult to find good design than bad ones. ” Because good design are so natural, it can help users to easily meet the targets, so that the users are not aware of the existence of good design.

After referring to the summary and reasoning of design principles from The Non-Designer’s Design Book” and “Designing Web Interfaces”, and combining with our practice and understanding of the team, we developed the following ten principles, which provide specific criteria and enlightenment of the solutions to problem for designers.

> Note: the design principle is the abstraction and summary of representational design. However, users’ perception of the entire product is from global aspect to local aspect. So it is not desirable to ignore the full picture and only use partial principles. For the design principles, designers should learn them rationally, and then abandon them bravely.
