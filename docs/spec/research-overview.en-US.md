In the Exploration channel, we will publicly share the design patterns we are researching and improving, as well as unfinished content. Most of the content can be built using existing antd components. Of course, there may be a small number of new components that have not yet been developed. The original intention of opening the Exploration channel is to improve Ant Design together with users. If you are using this content, your feedback can help us optimize and iterate faster, and promote components to enter the development state as soon as possible.
