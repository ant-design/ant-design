## Use Cases

### New User Guidance

Generally, new users expect empty states to have explanatory notes and recommended actions. Empty states are very useful in scenarios of first-time use of an application or feature, as they show the functionality and process to users and help them get started quickly. To assist new users in their first use, the empty state can be filled with feature guides, help documents, etc.

#### Using Guide Variations

The guide consists of three parts: state prompt, help guide, and suggested actions. During design, you can choose modules based on the business process to form the page and variations. For empty state pages within a complex process, you can also provide process guide modules to help users understand the operation process globally, and provide text buttons for quick operations related to the process.

### Completion or Clearance

This empty state occurs when users voluntarily delete data from the feature. For example, customers have completed all items on their task list or read all notifications. Generally, this type of scenario does not require action guidance, just use graphical elements or prompt information to explain the empty state.

### No Data

The scenario of no data in the content area is displayed with a combination of graphical elements, prompt information, and suggested actions. Whether to provide suggested actions depends on the use case.
