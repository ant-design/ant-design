This guide explains how to enable AI tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude to better understand Ant Design.

## What is LLMs.txt?

We support [LLMs.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) files for making the Ant Design documentation available to large language models (LLMs). This feature helps AI tools better understand our component library, its APIs, and usage patterns.

## Available Routes

We provide several LLMs.txt routes to help AI tools access our documentation:

- [llms.txt](https://ant.design/llms.txt) - Contains a structured overview of all components and their documentation links
- [llms-full.txt](https://ant.design/llms-full.txt) - Provides comprehensive documentation including implementation details and examples

## Usage with AI Tools

### Cursor

Use the `@Docs` feature in Cursor to include the LLMs.txt files in your project. This helps Cursor provide more accurate code suggestions and documentation for Ant Design components.

### Windsurf

Reference the LLMs.txt files using `@` or in your `.windsurf/rules` files to enhance Windsurf's understanding of Ant Design components.

### Claude Code

In Claude Code, add `LLMs.txt` to the workspace Knowledge Base (Docs / Context Files) configuration. This allows the file to be referenced during code completion and explanation, improving understanding of Ant Design components.

### Gemini CLI

In Gemini CLI, you can specify the `LLMs.txt` file path with the `--context` parameter or in `.gemini/config.json`, enabling Gemini to reference the document when answering or generating code.

### Trae

In Trae, place the `LLMs.txt` file into the projectâ€™s knowledge sources and enable referencing in the settings. This allows Trae to better support Ant Design components when generating or analyzing code.

### Qoder

In Qoder, you can add `LLMs.txt` as an external knowledge file in `.qoder/config.yml`, or temporarily reference it in a conversation with `@docs LLMs.txt`, enhancing support for Ant Design components.

### Other AI Tools

Any AI tool that supports LLMs.txt can use these routes to better understand Ant Design. Simply point your tool to any of the routes above.
