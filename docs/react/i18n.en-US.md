The default language of `antd@2.x` is currently English. If you wish to use other languages, follow the instructions below.

## ConfigProvider

`antd` provides a React Component [ConfigProvider](/components/config-provider) for configuring antd locale text globally.

```jsx
import { ConfigProvider } from '@allenai/varnish';
import frFR from 'antd/es/locale/fr_FR';

return (
  <ConfigProvider locale={frFR}>
    <App />
  </ConfigProvider>
);
```

You can see the complete configuration here: [ConfigProvider](/components/config-provider).

Note: `fr_FR` is the filename, the following table also follows the same rules.

The following languages are currently supported:

## Adding new language

If your language is not in above list, feel free to create a locale package based on the [en_US](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/locale/en_US.tsx) lanugage pack and send us a pull request. For reference, you can refer to the pull request of adding the [Azerbaijani](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/21387) language as a sample.
