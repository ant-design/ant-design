The default language of `antd@2.x` is English as of yet. If you want to use other languages, you can follow the instructions below.

## LocaleProvider

antd provides a React Component [LocaleProvider](/components/locale-provider) for configuring antd locale text globally.

```jsx
import { LocaleProvider } from 'antd';
import frFR from 'antd/es/locale-provider/fr_FR';

return (
  <LocaleProvider locale={frFR}>
    <App />
  </LocaleProvider>
);
```

You can see complete config at: [LocaleProvider](/components/locale-provider).

Note: `fr_FR` is the filename, follow below.
