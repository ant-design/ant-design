The default language of `antd@2.x` is currently English. If you wish to use other languages, follow the instructions below.

## ConfigProvider

`antd` provides a React Component [ConfigProvider](/components/config-provider) for configuring antd locale text globally.

```jsx
import { ConfigProvider } from 'antd';
import frFR from 'antd/locale/fr_FR';

return (
  <ConfigProvider locale={frFR}>
    <App />
  </ConfigProvider>
);
```

You can see the complete configuration here: [ConfigProvider](/components/config-provider).

Note: `fr_FR` is the filename, the following table also follows the same rules.

The following languages are currently supported:

## Adding new language

If your language is not in above list, feel free to create a locale package based on the [en_US](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/locale/en_US.ts) language pack and send us a pull request. For reference, you can refer to the pull request of adding the [Azerbaijani](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/21387) language as a sample.

Do it step by step:

1. Fork `antd` and git clone to local, switch to `feature` branch, pull it to make sure it's up-to-date, create a new branch based on `feature` branch, all work will be done in it.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:<your organization>/ant-design.git
   cd ant-design/
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:ant-design/ant-design.git
   git checkout -b <your new branch name> upstream/feature
   ```

2. Add the language support for [rc-picker](https://github.com/react-component/picker), for example [this](https://github.com/react-component/picker/blob/master/src/locale/en_US.ts).
3. Add the language support for [rc-pagination](https://github.com/react-component/pagination), for example [this](https://github.com/react-component/pagination/blob/master/src/locale/en_US.js).
4. Wait for `rc-picker` and `rc-pagination` to release the new version containing the above.
5. Update the `rc-picker` and `rc-pagination` versions in `antd` and add the remaining other necessary content for the language. for example [Azerbaijani PR](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/21387).
6. Add a test case for the language in [index.test.tsx](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/locale-provider/__tests__/index.test.tsx).
7. update snapshots, you may also need to delete `node_modules`, lock files (`yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`) and reinstall at first.

   ```bash
   npm run test -- components/locale -u
   ```

8. Add the language to i18n list [docs/react/i18n.en-US.md](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/docs/react/i18n.en-US.md) and [docs/react/i18n.zh-CN.md](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/docs/react/i18n.zh-CN.md).
9. Watch out the CI status, and if it failed, look at the logs and make some changes until it all passes.
10. Ok, now everything is ready for review.
