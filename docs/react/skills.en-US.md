This guide introduces Ant Design skills for AI tools and agent workflows.

## What is SKILL.md? {#what-is-skill-md}

`SKILL.md` defines a skill package. In this repository, the `antd-components` skill lives in `.skills/components/SKILL.md`, and each component reference lives under `.skills/components/references`.

## How to use {#how-to-use-skill}

1. Add `.skills/components/SKILL.md` to your tool's skill registry or context.
2. When working with a component, load the matching reference file from `.skills/components/references/Component.md`.

## Component skills {#component-skill-list}

Below is a concise list of supported component skills and a copyable command for each one. The copied command downloads the reference from GitHub and copies the Markdown content to your clipboard.

> Note: The command uses macOS `pbcopy`. Replace it with `clip` on Windows or `xclip -selection clipboard` on Linux.
