description: Help sustain Ant Design development via OpenCollective.
---

Ant Design is MIT licensed and free to use. The effort required to maintain and evolve a large UI library is only sustainable with the support from our community and sponsors.

- If you are using Ant Design to build a revenue-generating product, sponsoring helps ensure the project remains healthy and actively maintained. It is also a great way to demonstrate your company's support for Open Source.
- If you enjoy Ant Design, consider sponsoring as a way to show appreciation and help keep the project moving forward.

We'd like to thank the following companies and individuals for their generous sponsorship and support!
