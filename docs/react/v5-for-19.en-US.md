:::info{title="Compatibility Interface"}
antd v5 compatibility with React 16 ~ 18 by default. For React 19, you can use the following compatibility methods to adapt.
:::

### React 19 Compatibility Issues

Since React 19 adjusted the export method of `react-dom`, antd cannot directly use the `ReactDOM.render` method. Therefore, using antd will encounter the following problems:

- Wave effect does not show
- Static methods of `Modal`, `Notification`, `Message` not working

Therefore, you need to use a compatibility configuration to make antd work properly in React 19.

### Compatibility Methods

You can choose one of the following methods, and it is recommended to use the compatibility package first.

#### Compatibility Package

Install the compatibility package

```bash
npm install --save-dev @ant-design/v5-patch-for-react-19
```

Import the compatibility package at the application entry

```tsx
import '@ant-design/v5-patch-for-react-19';
```

#### unstableSetRender

Once again, please use the compatibility package first. Only for special scenarios such as umd, micro-applications, etc., use the `unstableSetRender` method. `unstableSetRender` is a low-level registration method that allows developers to modify the rendering method of ReactDOM. Write the following code at the entry of your application:

```js
import { unstableSetRender } from 'antd';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

unstableSetRender((node, container) => {
  container._reactRoot ||= createRoot(container);
  const root = container._reactRoot;
  root.render(node);
  return async () => {
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 0));
    root.unmount();
  };
});
```
