Hi, I'm [kiner-tang](https://github.com/kiner-tang) who is a heavy user of Ant Design. As the same reason, I come up to be a contributor for fixing bug and some features. Finally, it's my honer to become a member of Ant Design Collaborator.

During the journey from user to contributor, and then from contributor to collaborator, I also encountered many problems. I would like to share my experience with the problem I meet. Hope it can help you to join the Ant Design community.

## Some frequently asked Questions

### About dependent version

There are various of package mangers, such as npm, yarn, or pnpm, providing version-locking solutions to avoid version-inconsistencies issue.However, in Ant Design projects, many functions depend on the original components in the `react-component` repository. We expect that when we encounter some bugs, after the `react-component` fixes and releases the patch version, Instead of manually upgrading the version in the Ant Design project, we can install the latest patch installation package only by reinstalling the dependencies. At this point, the version-lock file provided by the package manager is the main obstacle to automatic updates, because once the version-lock file is available, reinstalling the dependency will also install the version specified by the lock file and cannot be upgraded to the patch version.

Based on the above reasons, we adopt the following methods:

1. Add `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` and other version lock files to `.gitignore` without version tracking.

2. In `package.json`, for the dependencies that we want to update when there is a new patch version, we use `~` description version number to allow patch version update.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "rc-cascader": "~3.9.0"
  }
}
```

For the difference between `^` and `~` in the version description of package.json, see [What's the difference between tilde(~) and caret(^) in package.json](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22343224/whats-the-difference-between-tilde-and-caret-in-package-json).

Thus, when our dependency such as rc-cascader fixes a bug and releases a patch version such as: `3.9.1`, then the user's latest installed version is `3.9.1`. For the maintainer of Ant Design, we only need to execute the following command:

```bash
git clean -fdx
npm i
```

### Snapshot update problem

In Ant Design, we use Jest for unit test. Many first-time contributors of Ant Design may be confused that CI failed after opening a pull request in which they just modify the text in a demo. This is caused by the snapshot diff test.

In most libraries, idempotence is emphasized. With one method and same parameters, the result should be the same no matter how many times it is executed. In Ant Design, the main use of snapshot test is to verify the idempotence of demos, in order to ensure the stability and certainty of components. Actually, snapshot test is simple. By comparing HTML string generated by each demo in different runnings, we could get which one is broken in PR.

Back to the topic, what should we do if we find snapshot test failed after changing a demo?

1. First, we need to check the snapshot diff to see whether it is the expected change. If there is only the text you modified in demo differs from the origin one, we just need to run the following command to update the snapshot:

   ```bash
   # Run the test command to update snapshot
   npm run test -u
   ```

2. However, we should find what's going wrong if the diff of snapshot is not only cause by your modification this time. For example, you only modified the text, but found that classnames in snapshots have changed, which obviously does not meet expectations.

   The common causes are as follows:

   - Local dependency is out of date. This may happen when you pull the latest code, but did not update the local dependency. Deleting `lock` file, `node_modules`, and then reinstalling dependencies could solve this problem.

     solution is as simple as deleting the lock file、node_modules and reinstall dependencies.

   - Your code not synchronizing baseline code can also result in inconsistent snapshot comparisons. The solution is as simple as pulling the baseline code locally and then rebase your code to the baseline code.

   - You may have locally changed the core code in addition to the demo, causing the logic to change. You need to go over this change carefully.

### rc-x Library dependencies

In Ant Design, most components are an upper encapsulation of a component based on `react-component`. Therefore, if a user reports a bug, when we troubleshoot the problem, if we find the problem is in the `@rc-component/xxx` or `rc-xxx` component, Then we need to put pr on those components to fix it. After the fix, we need to verify the fix results in the Ant Design project, then we can link the project to the Ant Design project for verification.For example:

Run `npm link` under the rc project.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10286961/224603053-98488c2d-f33c-4c25-8c09-6c790cfcdbf6.png)

Run `npm link "Project name"` in Ant Design

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10286961/224603065-95715727-83d0-4ef9-81e4-3b7065aaf73e.png)

Once we have verified, we can mention pr to the rc component. It should be noted that link may cause an exception when running the test command. Therefore, after local verification, we need to run the following

command locally to delete the package from link:

```bash
npm unlink "rc-field-form" --no-save
npm i
```

When the pr is finally merged, usually the maintainer will release a version. If the patch version is released, then you only need to install and verify it in the Ant Design project, but if the minor version is released, Then we also need to take the initiative to upgrade the version in the Ant Design project, and after passing the local verification, a separate pr to Ant Design for upgrade repair.

### Property expiration

In a large project, if you want to scrap an property or method, it is actually very troublesome, because your project may already have a lot of items in use, if you kill it, then others upgrade the console screen will be red, or even can't run. But in the process of project iteration, we will encounter more and more scenes and problems, a long time ago solution may no longer fit, really need to scrap, then, we need to adopt a soft, less radical way to scrap, leave enough time for users to modify.

In Ant Design, we adopt a **five-step strategic** obsolescence property or method:

1. **Add an expiration mark to the property**

   ![003](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10286961/224358324-8f72f2c0-d5bb-4281-9b29-7e2428353449.png)

   When we add the above expired tag, we can see later using this variable:

   ![004](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10286961/224358351-958a168d-41de-44b0-8244-2f8d67c4d13a.png)

2. **Add console warnings**

![005](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10286961/224358371-09f08f79-8c95-4126-b382-59311bb702d6.png)

It is important to note that after adding console warnings, we need to add a test case to the test case to test whether the warnings will be displayed if the expired properties are used, so as to ensure that the warnings can be displayed normally.

![006](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10286961/224358407-3d89d2f5-b4aa-48b4-aab8-1331a0f620fa.png)

3. **Update document**: The above two steps are mainly to warn developers in the editor and browser. Next, we need to update the related document. Generally speaking, if we have a property deprecated, it means that it is not recommended for users to use. So we need to remove the related document and add the description of the new property at the mean time. If it cannot be deleted due to special circumstances, please specify the version this property is supported and the alternative scheme in the remarks column.

4. **Compatibility between old and new**: Now that we're done with the above tips, it's important to make sure that the new property and the deprecated one both works until the deprecated one is removed. That is to say, we must have the deprecated property work normally. We should not apply any changes in addition to the warning.

   ![007](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10286961/224358439-76c42c78-e244-42bd-8935-b08f536931a2.png)

   We can do something like this, making sure that the new property takes precedence over the old one, and only trying to use the old one if no new one exists.At this point, our property expiration work is done.

5. **Remove**: After our properties have been deprecated for a certain period of time, usually when the major version is released, we can remove the them. We also need to delete comments, warnings, test cases, and documents that were related the property. At this point our property removal work is done.

## Take it to the next level

After contributing for some time, we believe you have gained a deeper understanding of Ant Design's overall development process and project architecture. At this point, you may want to take on more tasks and contribute more to the open source community. Then, you can apply to be a Collaborator at Ant Design by commenting on the link below for more active contributors. [Add Collaborator permission for some active contributors](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/3222), The Collaborators will then start the voting process, and after passing the voting, they will invite you to officially become a Collaborator at Ant Design.

After you become a newly appointed Ant Design collaborator, you will be assigned some additional rights, such as:

- Tag the issue
- Close the issue
- Free to create branches under the Ant Design project
- Free to merge approved PR

- ...

There are some caveats to this.

### Merge PR

It's time to merge PR! Ant Design use both squash merge and commit merge in different case which requires attention. Follow is some introduce about difference:

![008](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10286961/224358476-2332e36f-0adf-486f-8b17-1b2ad34926aa.jpg)

- **Merge pull request**: Merge the current PR into the target branch normally (usually used when branches merge with each other, and commit records will not be merged. Do not use this when merging PRs, otherwise too many redundant commit records will be added to the target branch).
- **Squash and merge**: Merge the commit record into one and merge it into the target branch (this is usually used for merging PRs).
- **Rebase and merge**：When you want to adjust the baseline

Merge in Ant Design requires at least one collaborator's approve. Collaborator who approved should ensure PR are fully reviewed and confirm.

### Identify XY Problems

During routine maintenance, some issues can easily reproduce but some others are not. Report sometime get stuck in XY problem which makes requirement or bug question strange to understand. Thus, before resolving the superficial problems, we should dig into the real question.

## Epilogue

Hoping that more and more contributors and collaborators will join us to build a more efficient and elegant Ant Design.
