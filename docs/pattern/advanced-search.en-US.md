## Conventions

### Interaction

Conventionally used with deep tables, suitable for search conditions as well as searching for a number of unknown values ​​within a range.

Advanced search is generally used by intermediate / expert users, typically by clicking advanced search. If you are displaying complex data, you can expand advanced search by default.

Click advanced search to expand Advanced Search again.' src="https://os.alipayobjects.com/rmsportal/gKiZtjopvLufqSP.png">

When an advanced search - with an entered a value - is hidden, you should display the search criteria and values.

### Arrangement
