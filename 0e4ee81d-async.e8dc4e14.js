Therefore, users need to directly modify the values of CSS variables in the script, introducing the problem of 'needing to know the hash value in advance.' If the hash value is completely random or calculated based on tokens, users cannot use this hash value outside the React lifecycle, or it is challenging to save this hash value for use in scripts outside the React lifecycle.",paraId:50,tocIndex:10},{value:"In other words, as long as the user knows the hash value, is that sufficient? Therefore, we allow users to customize the hash value, and users do not need to worry about the loss of style isolation due to custom reasons\u2014because we can easily detect if users are using the same hash value in the application. In this way, users only need to override hashed CSS variables in the format of Ant Design (antd)\u2014we can provide a factory function to help users generate CSS variable styles.",paraId:51,tocIndex:10},{value:"After ceasing the active calculation of the hash, two questions arise:",paraId:52,tocIndex:11},{value:"Is it still a hash?",paraId:53,tocIndex:11},{value:"Do we still need to add hash to the styles?",paraId:53,tocIndex:11},{value:"The first question is somewhat philosophical. From a historical perspective, it is still a hash. However, since it is no longer necessary to compute it, it is simply a pure random value or a user-defined string.",paraId:54,tocIndex:11},{value:"The second question is crucial. Now that all tokens have been replaced, styles under different themes no longer have any differences, and the isolating role played by the hash is no longer significant. We still add the hash class to the DOM as the scope of the theme, which directly affects where the components derive their CSS variable values. However, the styles themselves do not care about these, so we can optimize further:",paraId:55,tocIndex:11},{value:"Styles can now exist independently! This means that different themes can share the same set of styles\u2014there is no longer a need to generate these styles repeatedly.",paraId:56,tocIndex:11},{value:"However, we still need to consider micro-application scenarios. Although hash values are isolated between different versions of antd, styles lose their scope without a hash. Without hash, different versions of antd can contaminate each other. Therefore, we will still provide the ability to apply hash to the overall styles of the application\u2014this is the application-level hash. Unlike the theme hash, the entire application can still reuse the same set of styles.",paraId:57,tocIndex:11}];}}]);
